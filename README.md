# 🔁 DistributedKV

**DistributedKV** is a fault-tolerant distributed key-value store written in Python.

It implements **consistent hashing**, **replication**, and **quorum-based reads/writes** to ensure high availability and resilience to node failures. Heartbeat monitoring enables failure detection and recovery simulation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🌀 **Consistent hashing ring** for scalable key distribution
- 🔌 **TCP-based node-to-node communication**
- 📦 **Replication** with tunable **quorum (W+R > N)** logic
- ❤️‍🔥 **Heartbeat-based failure detection**
- 🧪 **Simulated clients** and **dynamic recovery** of failed nodes
